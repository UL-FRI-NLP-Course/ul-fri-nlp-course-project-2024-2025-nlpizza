A: 1. The world's oceans are becoming increasingly acidic due to the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is because the ocean's water is able to absorb carbon dioxide from the air, which then causes the ocean's water to become more acidic. 2. The acidic ocean can also cause problems for marine life, as it can cause marine animals to breathe more acidic air. 3.
