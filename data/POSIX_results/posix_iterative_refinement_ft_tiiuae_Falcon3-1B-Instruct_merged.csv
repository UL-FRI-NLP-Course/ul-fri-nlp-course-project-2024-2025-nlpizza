Let's first isolate the variable x on one side of the equation.

5(x - 7) = 2x + 4

Now, distribute the 5 to x-7:

5x - 35 = 2x + 4

Next, subtract 2x from both sides:

5x - 2x - 35 = 4

ANSWER","QUESTION	Discuss the effects of increased carbon dioxide on the global climate.
ANSWER","Q: Please refine the last answer.
A: 
Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have a number of effects on the global climate. These include: 
1. Warmer temperatures: Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures. This can lead to changes in weather patterns, such as more frequent and intense heatwaves and droughts. 
2. Changes in precipitation patterns: Carbon dioxide can also affect the amount and distribution of water in the atmosphere. This can lead to more frequent and intense storms, as well as longer periods of drought. 
3. Changes in ocean currents: Carbon dioxide can also affect the movement of heat in the ocean, leading to changes in ocean currents and the distribution of marine life. 
4. Impacts on the ozone layer: Increased levels of carbon dioxide can also affect the ozone layer, leading to increased levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface.

A:","Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have a significant impact on the global climate. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that absorbs and re-emits heat from the Earth's surface, trapping it in the atmosphere and causing the Earth's temperature to rise.
