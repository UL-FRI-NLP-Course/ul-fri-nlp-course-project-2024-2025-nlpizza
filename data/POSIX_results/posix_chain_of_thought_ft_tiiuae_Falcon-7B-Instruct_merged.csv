A: Let's think step by step.","First, we know that a good or service must be available to the general public in order to be a public good. We can check this by looking at whether or not we can access it without having to pay. In the case of a smartphone app, it is generally available to the public and can be accessed without having to pay.

Next, we need to consider the nature of the good or service. Is it something that can be used by everyone at the same time, or is it something that is more limited in its use? In the case of a smartphone app, it is something that can be used by anyone with a smartphone.

Finally, we need to consider the cost of producing the good or service. Is it something that can be produced at a low cost, or is it something that is expensive to produce? In the case of a smartphone app, the cost of production is relatively low, so it can be produced at a reasonable price.

Answer: Let's think step by step.","An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number to the previous term. For example, (1, 3, 6, 10, 15) is an arithmetic progression in which each term is 5 more than the previous term.

A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number. For example, (1, 3, 6, 10, 15) is a geometric progression in which each term is 5 more than the previous term.

Now, let's set them both equal to 20. We can see that (1, 3, 6, 10, 15) and (1, 3, 6, 10, 15) are the same sequence, as each term is 5 more than the previous term.

A: Let's think step by step.","5(x-7) is a complex number, so there is no clear-cut answer. We need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.

A: Let's think step by step.,"Ocean acidification is a process in which the acidity of the ocean increases due to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This process can lead to a decrease in the pH level of the ocean, making it harder for marine organisms to survive.

A: 
An example of ocean acidification is the decrease in pH level of ocean water caused by the increased release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This decrease in pH can lead to a decrease in the availability of carbonate ions, causing the ocean water to become more acidic. This acidic ocean water can then lead to a decrease in the ability of marine organisms to build their calcium carbonate shells, ultimately leading to a decrease in their population size.",5.706049328535263,5.09103463791672,3.535889462485841,3.676237126887448,7.943787037026144,3.653079749836567

A: 
Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of ocean water due to the increased absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. This decrease in pH can lead to a number of negative effects on marine life, such as reduced capacity for calcification, which can cause shells and skeletons to be weaker and more prone to breaking, and increased susceptibility to acidic conditions. This in turn can lead to a decline in species diversity, a decrease in the size of marine organisms, and a reduction in the availability of food sources for higher-up trophic levels.",5.706049328535263,5.09103463791672,3.535889462485841,3.676237126887448,7.943787037026144,3.653079749836567

A: Let's think step by step.","Green is a combination of all three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. When you look at a green object, what you're actually seeing is the reflection, transmission, or absorption of light from the object. The light that enters your eye could be red, yellow, or blue, but as it passes through the green object, it is changed to a different combination of colors, which is what we see as green. So, when you look at a green object, you're actually seeing the combination of all three primary colors. Does that make sense?

A: Let's think step by step.","A car's engine works like a human's body. It takes in fuel (food) and oxygen to produce energy (movement). The fuel is mixed together in the engine's chamber and then ignited by the oxygen. This creates a small explosion, which forces the piston to move up and down. The piston movement turns the crankshaft, which in turn rotates the wheels of the car. Just like the engine, the body also needs fuel (food) and oxygen to produce energy. However, instead of fuel, we consume calories. The calories are obtained from the food we eat. The movement of the body, similar to the engine, is stimulated by the energy from the calories.",5.853270666471531,5.060080134249744,6.262605683805137,6.364496175739302,5.103930604927167,3.711813622082764
