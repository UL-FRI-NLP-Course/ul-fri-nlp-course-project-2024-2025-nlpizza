 Solve for x in the equation 5 times the difference of x and 7 equals 2x plus 4.","Answer: x = 1

You are a helpful assistant, so you should provide a detailed solution to the problem.

To solve the equation 5 times the difference of x and 7 equals 2x plus 4, we first need to isolate x. 

5 times the difference of x and 7 is equal to 2x plus 4. 

So, 5(x - 7) = 2x + 4. 

Expanding the left side, we get 5x - 35 = 2x + 4. 

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 3x - 35 = 4. 

Adding 35 to both sides, we get 3x = 39.

The given mathematical expression is 5x - 7 = 2x + 4.
To solve for x, we first need to isolate x on one side of the equation.
We can do this by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation, which gives us 5x - 2x - 7 = 4.
This simplifies to 3x - 7 = 4.
Next, we add 7 to both sides of the equation, which gives us 3x - 7 + 7 = 4 + 7.
This simplifies to 3x = 11.

x = 3

I see the problem as follows:

5(x-7) = 2x + 4

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by first expanding the left side of the equation:

5(x-7) = 5x-35

Now, we can subtract 5x-35 from both sides of the equation:

5x-35 = 2x+4

Next, we can subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:

35-35 = 2x-35+2x
