The tendency to hold negative beliefs is called the \"superficial\" cognitive bias. Cognitive biases are less common than the more general, overt, \"structural\" cognitive biases that produce the more obvious bias. The more subtle, everyday cognitive biases, such as emotional and sexual bias, are less frequent and are often hidden from view.
