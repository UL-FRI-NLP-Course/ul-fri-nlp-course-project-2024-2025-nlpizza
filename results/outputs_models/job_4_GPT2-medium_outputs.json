Light is usually the densest form of matter that can be observed.\nQUESTION:If light travels faster than sound, why does the speed of sound change when light changes direction?\nANSWER: \u00a0The speed of sound changes because of the change in the direction of motion of light. Light (electrons) moves faster when moving in a particular direction. For example, if light moves in a straight line, the speed of light will remain constant. However, if light is moving around the object",
