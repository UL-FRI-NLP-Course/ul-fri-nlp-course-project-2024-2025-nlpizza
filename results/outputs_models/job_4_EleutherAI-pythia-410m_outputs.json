    "Light does not make any sound.\n\nA:\n\nLight does not make any sound.\n\nIt's true that light is a wave moving faster than sound. If you want to be precise about this, you could say that by itself that wave would require a sound. But wave is a wave in motion, not a wave in motion, so the wave in motion can be measured by the speed of the wave, not the speed of light.\nThe speed of light is a constant of nature. To measure it, you need the speed of light in a vacuum, which is the speed of light in free space (",
