Answer -","A middleware program to filter all incoming requests on a website can be written in a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, or C++. The program should be designed to intercept all incoming requests and check if they meet certain criteria, such as a specific user agent or IP address. If the request meets the criteria, the program should allow the request to pass through to the website's backend. If the request does not meet the criteria, the program should reject it and send an error message back to the user.
